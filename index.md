# ShadowOps Lab

Welcome to the **ShadowOps Lab** — a hands‑on portfolio showcasing adversarial security research, automation, and reproducible harness design.  
This project demonstrates practical offensive security workflows, with a focus on clarity, auditability, and recruiter‑ready presentation.

## What’s New in Phase 2

Phase 2 introduces the **AI‑Adversarial Payload Generator**, extending the lab with reproducible, mutated payloads for red‑team simulation.

## Project Goals

- Build reproducible, audit‑grade adversarial harnesses  
- Demonstrate automation in payload generation and analysis  
- Provide recruiter‑ready artifacts with clear documentation  
- Maintain modular design for future expansion (SOC Replay Capsule, IoT Capsule, etc.)

---

## Repository Structure

- `modules/` → Harness modules (AI payloads, SOC replay, etc.)  
- `artifacts/` → Generated outputs, logs, and payloads  
- `assets/` → Screenshots and supporting visuals for documentation  
- `index.md` → GitHub Pages landing page  

---

## Next Steps

- Expand Phase 2 with additional adversarial modules  
- Integrate SOC Replay Capsule for incident response simulation  
- Continue publishing reproducible artifacts and documentation
