# ðŸš€ Phase 2 â€“ Expansion (1â€“2 Months)

Phaseâ€¯2 expands ShadowOpsâ€‘Lab into new offensive and defensive domains while preserving the reproducibility and auditâ€‘friendly rigor established in Phaseâ€¯1. Each capability is paired with replay capsules and crossâ€‘platform validation to ensure clarity, artifact completeness, and reviewerâ€‘proof reproducibility.

## Key Objectives
- **Supply Chain Attack Simulator**  
  Simulate malicious dependency injection in CI/CD pipelines to test detection and response.

- **IoT Exploit Capsule**  
  Emulate vulnerable smart devices (e.g., healthcare sensors, home IoT) for exploit replay and SOC validation.

- **AIâ€‘Adversarial Payload Generator**  
  Generate AIâ€‘mutated payloads designed to bypass WAF/IDS, validating resilience against adversarial inputs.

- **Crossâ€‘Platform Proof**  
  Demonstrate reproducibility across Linux, macOS, and Windows environments, ensuring consistent artifacts and reviewer clarity.

âœ… *By the end of Phaseâ€¯2, the harness will demonstrate scalability across multiple domains while maintaining symmetry between probes and replay capsules.*
