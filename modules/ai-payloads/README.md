# ðŸ¤– AI-Adversarial Payload Generator

**Purpose:**  
This module explores nextâ€‘generation adversarial payloads â€” fuzzing, mutation, and AIâ€‘driven variations â€” to simulate how attackers may weaponize automation against modern defenses.

**Features (Planned):**
- AIâ€‘mutated HTTP header fuzzing
- Token/parameter mutation for web apps
- Replay capsule integration for SOC validation
- Crossâ€‘platform reproducibility

**Artifacts:**
- `artifacts/` â†’ stores generated payloads, logs, and reports
- Each run is timestamped for auditability

**Usage (stub):**
```bash
./harness.sh --target <URL> --mode fuzz
