# ShadowOps Lab
**Multi‑Purpose Next‑Gen Penetration Testing & SOC Training Framework**

> ShadowOps Lab is a reproducible, next‑gen security framework that trains you to **attack like a pentester and defend like a SOC analyst** — all in one lab.

---

## 🎯 Core Idea
ShadowOps Lab is designed as a **multi‑purpose framework** that bridges offensive and defensive security:

- **Attack like a pentester** → Recon, fuzzing, exploit modules.
- **Defend like a SOC analyst** → Forensic replay capsule with logs, detection rules, timelines.
- **Expand into next‑gen domains** → AI payloads, supply chain, IoT, post‑quantum crypto.

This dual approach ensures:
- Recruiters see you can attack *and* defend.
- SOC leaders see you understand real‑world detection.
- Pentest managers see you’re already thinking about 2026 threats.

## 🛠️ Phase 1 (MVP – Job‑Ready in 2–3 Weeks)
- **Recon & Exploit Harness** → automated recon + one exploit module (AI‑mutated web fuzzing).
- **SOC Replay Capsule** → logs + replay timeline + Sigma/YARA rules.
- **Executive Summary Generator** → severity distribution + one‑line risk profile.
- **README.md** → polished storytelling:  
  *“ShadowOps simulates tomorrow’s threats in a reproducible way.”*

👉 This is enough to land interviews as a SOC Analyst or Junior Pentester.

## 🚀 Phase 2 (Expansion – 1–2 Months)
- **Supply Chain Attack Simulator** → malicious dependency injection in CI/CD.
- **IoT Exploit Capsule** → emulate smart devices (healthcare, home IoT).
- **AI‑Adversarial Payload Generator** → bypass WAF/IDS with AI‑mutated payloads.
- **Cross‑Platform Proof** → Linux, macOS, Windows reproducibility.

---

## 🌍 Phase 3 (Global Shine – 3–6 Months)
- **Post‑Quantum Crypto Audit Module** → flag weak algorithms, suggest PQC replacements.
- **Self‑Evolving Red/Blue AI Loop** → AI red team generates payloads, AI blue team trains detection rules.
- **Professional Docs + Demo Video** → publish on GitHub, LinkedIn, Medium.
- **Branding** → position it as *“The Open‑Source Next‑Gen Pentest & SOC Training Framework.”*
