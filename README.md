# ShadowOps Lab
**Multiâ€‘Purpose Nextâ€‘Gen Penetration Testing & SOC Training Framework**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Idea
ShadowOps Lab is designed as a **multiâ€‘purpose framework** that bridges offensive and defensive security:

- **Attack like a pentester** â†’ Recon, fuzzing, exploit modules.
- **Defend like a SOC analyst** â†’ Forensic replay capsule with logs, detection rules, timelines.
- **Expand into nextâ€‘gen domains** â†’ AI payloads, supply chain, IoT, postâ€‘quantum crypto.

This dual approach ensures:
- Recruiters see you can attack *and* defend.
- SOC leaders see you understand realâ€‘world detection.
- Pentest managers see youâ€™re already thinking about 2026 threats.
