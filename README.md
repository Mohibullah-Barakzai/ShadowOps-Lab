> ShadowOps Lab is a reproducible, next‑gen security framework that trains you to **attack like a pentester and defend like a SOC analyst** — all in one lab.  
> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is under active development. Phase 1 MVP is being built — expect rapid changes.

## 🎯 Core Idea
ShadowOps Lab is designed as a **multi‑purpose framework** that bridges offensive and defensive security:

- **Attack like a pentester** → Recon, fuzzing, exploit modules.  
- **Defend like a SOC analyst** → Forensic replay capsule with logs, detection rules, timelines.  
- **Expand into next‑gen domains** → AI payloads, supply chain, IoT, post‑quantum crypto.  

This dual approach ensures:  
- Recruiters see you can attack *and* defend.  
- SOC leaders see you understand real‑world detection.  
- Pentest managers see you’re already thinking about 2026 threats.  

---

## 🛠️ Phase 1 (MVP – Job‑Ready in 2–3 Weeks)
- **Recon & Exploit Harness** → automated recon + one exploit module (AI‑mutated web fuzzing).  
- **SOC Replay Capsule** → logs + replay timeline + Sigma/YARA rules.  
- **Executive Summary Generator** → severity distribution + one‑line risk profile.  
- **README.md** → polished storytelling:  
  *“ShadowOps simulates tomorrow’s threats in a reproducible way.”*  

👉 This is enough to land interviews as a SOC Analyst or Junior Pentester.

# 🚀 Phase 2 – Expansion (1–2 Months)

Phase 2 expands ShadowOps‑Lab into new offensive and defensive domains while preserving the reproducibility and audit‑friendly rigor established in Phase 1. Each capability is paired with replay capsules and cross‑platform validation to ensure clarity, artifact completeness, and reviewer‑proof reproducibility.

## Key Objectives
- **Supply Chain Attack Simulator**  
  Simulate malicious dependency injection in CI/CD pipelines to test detection and response.

- **IoT Exploit Capsule**  
  Emulate vulnerable smart devices (e.g., healthcare sensors, home IoT) for exploit replay and SOC validation.

- **AI‑Adversarial Payload Generator**  
  Generate AI‑mutated payloads designed to bypass WAF/IDS, validating resilience against adversarial inputs.

- **Cross‑Platform Proof**  
  Demonstrate reproducibility across Linux, macOS, and Windows environments, ensuring consistent artifacts and reviewer clarity.

---

✅ *By the end of Phase 2, the harness will demonstrate scalability across multiple domains while maintaining symmetry between probes and replay capsules.*



## 🌍 Phase 3 (Global Shine – 3–6 Months)
- **Post‑Quantum Crypto Audit Module** → flag weak algorithms, suggest PQC replacements.  
- **Self‑Evolving Red/Blue AI Loop** → AI red team generates payloads, AI blue team trains detection rules.  
- **Professional Docs + Demo Video** → publish on GitHub, LinkedIn, Medium.  
- **Branding** → position it as *“The Open‑Source Next‑Gen Pentest & SOC Training Framework.”*  

---

## 📌 Executive Summary
ShadowOps Lab is more than a project — it’s a reproducible, next‑gen security framework that proves mastery across offensive and defensive domains.  
It demonstrates immediate job‑readiness (Phase 1), clear growth potential (Phase 2), and long‑term vision (Phase 3).  
For recruiters and reviewers, it signals a candidate who can **attack, defend, and innovate** — all with reproducibility and clarity.

## 🤝 Contributing & Roadmap

ShadowOps Lab is currently a **work in progress**. The roadmap is structured into clear phases:

- **Phase 1 (MVP – Job Ready)** → Recon harness, SOC replay capsule, executive summary generator.  
- **Phase 2 (Expansion)** → Supply chain simulator, IoT capsule, AI‑adversarial payloads.  
- **Phase 3 (Global Shine)** → Post‑quantum audit, AI red/blue loop, professional docs & demo.

### How to Contribute
While this project is primarily my personal research lab, contributions are welcome in the form of:
- **Issues** → Suggestions, bug reports, or feature ideas.  
- **Pull Requests** → Small, focused improvements (scripts, docs, detection rules).  
- **Discussions** → Feedback on methodology, reproducibility, or new attack/defense domains.  

### Guidelines
- Keep commits **atomic and reproducible**.  
- Document changes clearly in `README.md` or `docs/`.  
- Ensure scripts are **cross‑platform friendly** (Linux/macOS/Windows).  
- Always prioritize **clarity, reproducibility, and reviewer impact**.
