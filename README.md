# ShadowOps Lab
**Multi‑Purpose Next‑Gen Penetration Testing & SOC Training Framework**

---

## 🎯 Core Idea
ShadowOps Lab is designed as a **multi‑purpose framework** that bridges offensive and defensive security:

- **Attack like a pentester** → Recon, fuzzing, exploit modules.
- **Defend like a SOC analyst** → Forensic replay capsule with logs, detection rules, timelines.
- **Expand into next‑gen domains** → AI payloads, supply chain, IoT, post‑quantum crypto.

This dual approach ensures:
- Recruiters see you can attack *and* defend.
- SOC leaders see you understand real‑world detection.
- Pentest managers see you’re already thinking about 2026 threats.

## 🛠️ Phase 1 (MVP – Job‑Ready in 2–3 Weeks)
- **Recon & Exploit Harness** → automated recon + one exploit module (AI‑mutated web fuzzing).
- **SOC Replay Capsule** → logs + replay timeline + Sigma/YARA rules.
- **Executive Summary Generator** → severity distribution + one‑line risk profile.
- **README.md** → polished storytelling:  
  *“ShadowOps simulates tomorrow’s threats in a reproducible way.”*

👉 This is enough to land interviews as a SOC Analyst or Junior Pentester.
